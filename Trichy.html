<h1> Trichy </h1>
<h3 style="color: red">Historically, Tiruchirappalli was commonly referred to in English as "Trichinopoly".[11] The shortened forms "Trichy" or "Tiruchi" are used in everyday speech and the full name Tiruchirapalli appears in official use by government and quasi-government offices but seldom used by the general public.

According to the late scholar C. P. Brown, Tiruchirappalli might be a derivative of the word Chiruta-palli (lit. "little town").[14][15] Orientalists Henry Yule and Arthur Coke Burnell have speculated that the name may derive from a rock inscription carved in the 16th century in which Tiruchirappalli is written as Tiru-ssila-palli, meaning "holy-rock-town" in Tamil.[14][15] Other scholars have suggested that the name Tiruchirappalli is a rewording of Tiru-chinna-palli, meaning "holy little town".[14][15] The Madras Glossary gives the root as Tiruccinappalli or the "holy (tiru) village (palli) of the shina (Cissampelos pareira) plant".[15]

According to Hindu mythology, Tiruchirappalli derives its name from the three-headed demon Trishira, who meditated on the Hindu god Shiva near the present-day city to obtain favours from the god.[14] An alternative derivation, albeit not universally accepted is that the source of the city's name is the Sanskrit word  meaning "three-headed", and palli or puram meaning "city".
